# PocketYoukai
A text-based, minamalistic RPG based in Japanese folklore and urban legends. Currently only for iOS Pythonista.

# Story
Though much of the story is cryptic and shrouded in mystery, this much is certain. You are trapped in a school filed with strange creatures and the one who put you there is the powerful Ryuugami. Aside from defeating the Ryuugami, there is no real goal to the game. You could take it on as your first enemy or never take it on at all. By exploring the school, you can try to piece together the broken shards of the story.

# Help!
Even though I love Japanese folklore and legends, I do not know every single one nor do I have the time to add them if I did know them all. If anyone out there knows of any that aren't here, then please add them to the 'enemies' section like en = Enemy('NAME', HP, XP-YEILD, MONEY-DROP)
